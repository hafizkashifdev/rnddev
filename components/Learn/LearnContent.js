                            What is R&D Tax Credits? 
                        <p></p>
                            We explain in simple terms

Research and Development (R&D) tax relief initiative supports companies that work on innovation in the field of science and technology. Tax relief can be claimed by companies that are looking for funds to support their research or develop an advance in their field. It can be claimed even on projects that are not successful. You are eligible to claim tax relief if your project meets the eligibility criteria as defined by HMRC.
                               
                            </p>

                        <div class="img-50-center">

                        <h2>Projects that count as R&D</h2>
                        <p>
                        Projects that work in the area of science and technology making an innovative advancement qualify for R&D relief. The qualified work for R&D relief must be entitled to a specific project to bring innovation in science and technology. Innovation in the field of social science is not considered eligible for tax relief.
                        </p>
                        To get R&D relief your project needs to fulfill the following parameters:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Innovation in science and technology</li>
                            <li>Had to overcome uncertainty</li>
                            <li>Tried to overcome this uncertainty</li>
                            <li>Could not be easily worked out by a professional in the field</li>
                           
                        </ul>
                        Your project may research or develop a new product, service or process or help in the improvement on an existing one.
                        <p></p>
                        <h2>Innovations in the field</h2>
                        <p>Your project must target to innovate in the field that it is related to and not just only benefit your business.  This means an advance cannot just be an existing technology that has been used for the first time in your sector. The product, service or process will still be considered an innovation even if it is created by some other company and is not popular.</p>


                        <h2>Convince that a professional in the field could not work this out</h2>

                        <p>You need to convince why an existing professional in the field could not work out the innovation proposed in your project. Explain why a professional could not easily work out your innovative proposal. Prove by showing that other attempts to find a solution failed.</p>

                        <p>Demonstrate that the people in your project are professionals of the field and explain the uncertainties affecting the results.</p>
