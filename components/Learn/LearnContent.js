                        Research and Development (R&D) tax relief initiative supports companies that work on innovation
                        in the field of science and technology. Tax relief can be claimed by companies that are looking
                        for funds to support their research or develop an advance in their field. It can be claimed even
                        on projects that are not successful. You are eligible to claim tax relief if your project meets
                        the eligibility criteria as defined by HMRC.

                        to bring innovation in science and technology. Innovation in the field of social science is not
                        considered eligible for tax relief.

                        for the first time in your sector. The product, service or process will still be considered an
                        innovation even if it is created by some other company and is not popular.</p>
