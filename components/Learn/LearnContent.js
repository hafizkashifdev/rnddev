                                    What is R&D Tax Credits?
                                    <p></p>
                                    We explain in simple terms

                                    Research and Development (R&D) tax relief initiative supports companies that work on innovation in the field of science and technology. Tax relief can be claimed by companies that are looking for funds to support their research or develop an advance in their field. It can be claimed even on projects that are not successful. You are eligible to claim tax relief if your project meets the eligibility criteria as defined by HMRC.

                                </p>
                            </blockquote>


                            <h2>Projects that count as R&D</h2>
                            <p>
                                Projects that work in the area of science and technology making an innovative advancement qualify for R&D relief. The qualified work for R&D relief must be entitled to a specific project to bring innovation in science and technology. Innovation in the field of social science is not considered eligible for tax relief.


                            </p>

                            <p>   To get R&D relief your project needs to fulfill the following parameters:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Innovation in science and technology</li>
                                <li>Had to overcome uncertainty</li>
                                <li>Tried to overcome this uncertainty</li>
                                <li>Could not be easily worked out by a professional in the field</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>Your project may research or develop a new product, service or process or help in the improvement on an existing one.</p>
                            <h2>Innovations in the field</h2>
                            <p>Your project must target to innovate in the field that it is related to and not just only benefit your business.  This means an advance cannot just be an existing technology that has been used for the first time in your sector. The product, service or process will still be considered an innovation even if it is created by some other company and is not popular.</p>


                            <h2>Convince that a professional in the field could not work this out</h2>

                            <p>You need to convince why an existing professional in the field could not work out the innovation proposed in your project. Explain why a professional could not easily work out your innovative proposal. Prove by showing that other attempts to find a solution failed.</p>

                            <p>Demonstrate that the people in your project are professionals of the field and explain the uncertainties affecting the results.</p>



                            <h2>Show there was uncertainty</h2>
                            <p>Show uncertainty in the field since it only exists when a subject matter expert can not conflict with the technical possibilities of proposed innovation.</p>

                            <p>A scientific or technological uncertainty exists when an expert on the subject cannot say if something is technologically possible or how it can be done after referring to all available evidence.</p>

                            <p>Explain how you tried to overcome the uncertainty in your project as you need to show the R&D project needed to go through the phases of research, analysis or testing to develop it.</p>

                            <p>Explain the strategies you took that helped you overcome the uncertainties in your project. You can simply explain the success and failure of your project.</p>


                            <h2>Understanding R&D tax credits </h2>
                            <p>Research and development (R&D) tax credits program is an initiative taken by the government to give incentives to companies investing in the field of innovation. Research and Development projects is a valuable source of income stream for businesses to invest that helps them accelerate hiring process consequently leading to growth.</p>


                            <h2>Is my business eligible for R&D tax credits?</h2>
                            <p>To benefit from R&D tax incentives, you must:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Be a limited company in the UK that is subject to Corporation Tax.</li>
                                <li>Have carried out qualifying research and development activities.</li>
                                <li>Have spent money on these projects.</li>
                            </ul>


                            <h2>Who qualifies for R&D tax credits?</h2>
                            <p>R&D can take place in any sector. It occurs in everything from wine-making to clinical bioengineering, and construction to software development.</p>


                            <h2> What counts as R&D?</h2>

                            <p>The government’s R&D criteria are purposefully broad. Whatever size or sector, if your company is taking a risk by attempting to ‘resolve scientific or technological uncertainties’ then you may be carrying out qualifying activity.
                                <br />This could include:
                            </p>




                            <p>Creating new products, processes or services</p>

                            <p>Changing or modifying an existing product, process or service</p>

                            <p>If you’re not sure if your project is possible, or you don’t know how to achieve it in practice, you could be resolving technological uncertainties and be carrying out qualifying R&D.</p>

                            <p>Within the government’s accepted research and development definition, R&D doesn’t have to have been successful to qualify. Further detail is available in our “RnDKoNecT Info page”.</p>

                            <p><strong>What costs qualify for R&D tax credits?</strong></p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Staff, including salaries, employer’s NIC, pension contributions and reimbursed expenses.</li>
                                <li>Subcontractors and freelancers. Materials and consumables including heat, light and power that are used up or transformed by the R&D process.</li>
                                <li>Some types of software.</li>
                                <li>Payments to the subjects of clinical trials.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>SME:</strong>
                                Fewer than 500 staff and either not more than €100 million turnover or €86 million gross assets. Most companies, including start-ups, fall into this category.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>Large company:</strong>  <br />
                                500 staff or more and either more than €100 million turnover or €86 million gross assets.
                                <br />
                                SME R&D relief allows companies to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>deduct an extra 130% of their qualifying costs from their yearly profit, as well as the normal 100% deduction, to make a total 230% deduction</li>
                                    <li>claim a tax credit if the company is loss making, worth up to 14.5% of the surrenderable loss</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br />
                                If you are classed as an SME for R&D tax credit purposes, your next step will be to make a claim via the SME R&D tax incentive. And if you are a large company, via the Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>Research and Development Expenditure Credit:</strong>  <br />
                                This replaces the relief previously available under the large company scheme.
                                <br />
                                Large companies can claim a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/corporation-tax-research-and-development-tax-relief-for-large-companies">Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) for working on R&D projects.</a>

                                <p>It can also be claimed by SMEs and large companies who have been subcontracted to do R&D work by a large company.

                                    <br />

                                    The RDEC is a tax credit, it was 11% of your qualifying R&D expenditure up to 31 December 2017
                                    <br />

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>12% from 1 January 2018 to 31 March 2020</li>
                                        <li>13% from 1 April 2020</li>

                                    </ul>


                                </p>

                                <p>However, there are a few factors such as grants and subcontracting that can restrict an SME from accessing the SME incentive. This means you may need to make a claim via RDEC – or via both incentives.</p>

                                <p>We help SMEs across all sectors receive millions of pounds every month to re-invest back into their businesses. It is possible to make use of R&D tax credits and grant funding together by using both incentives to ensure maximum value. Our experts are on hand to assist your enquiries or via our “expert portal” facility when you registered with us and processing a claim.</p>

                                <strong>How much is an R&D tax credit claim worth?</strong>


                            </p>

                            <p>
                                R&D tax credits are calculated based on your R&D spend. To make an R&D credit calculation, you need to identify qualifying expenditure and enhance it by the relevant rate (see below).This produces your ‘enhanced expenditure’.
                                <br />
                                When you deduct your enhanced expenditure from your taxable profits, or add it to your loss, it will result in:
                                <ul>






                                    <li>a Corporation Tax reduction if you are profit-making.</li>
                                    <li>a cash credit if you are loss-making.</li>
                                    <li>or a combination of the two.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <strong>R&D tax credit rates</strong></p>
                            <p>SMEs are able to claim up to 33p for every £1 spent on qualifying R&D activities. The average claim made by SMEs in the UK is £57,228 (2018-19).</p>
                            <p>Large companies are able to claim up to 11p for every £1 spent on qualifying R&D activities. The average large company (RDEC) claim in the UK is £632,931 (2018-19).</p>
