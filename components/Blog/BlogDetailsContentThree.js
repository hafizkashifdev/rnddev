//                         <h3>Preventing abuse of R&D tax relief for SMEs</h3>
//                         <p>
//                             Consultation is going on by the government to introduce a cap on the payable tax relief for
//                             SMEs. This proposal will limit the R&D tax relief with the introduction of anti-abuse cap to
//                             the payable tax on R&D projects. The main objective of this consultation is to discourage
//                             abusive tax relief claims without negatively impacting genuine R&D projects.
//                             <br /><br />
//                             The consultation acknowledges that R&D tax relief scheme encourages investment in business
//                             and is a fundamental part of the innovation program initiated by the government. The SME
//                             scheme is liberal in giving corporation tax deduction or payable tax credit for businesses
//                             running in loss. The payable tax credit offers substantial support to companies running in
//                             loss by giving them the flexibility to claim payment for their loss of R&D expense up to
//                             14.5%.
//                         </p>
//                         <div className="text-center">

//                         </div>
//                         <p>
//                             <br />
//                             As the tax credit makes cash payment to the R&D project from HMRC, the concern is increasing
//                             that tax credit has become a target for abuse. The government wants to regulate this abuse
//                             with the introduction of this cap which will be based on the companyâ€™s overall Pay As You
//                             Earn (PAYE) and National Insurance Contributions (NICs) liability during the accounting
//                             period the claim is for.
//                             <br /><br />
//                             This has been imposed on all R&D tax relief claims from April 2020. In order to make sure
//                             there is no negative impact on genuine R&D projects, the government is committed to consult
//                             before releasing the funds.
