                            incentive in the form of R&D Tax Credits. The HMRC introduced this incentive-based system to
                            provide funds to companies that are developing innovative products or altering existing ones
                            to create a better one. This tax relief program can give you a great opportunity to claim a
                            good portion of your R&D expenditure as tax credits helping you reduce your tax bill. To be

                            value to the society irrespective of the sector you innovate in.
